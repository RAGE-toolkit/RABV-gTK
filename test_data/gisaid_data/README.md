# GISAID Test Data

This directory should contain a small subset of GISAID data for testing purposes.
Please copy ~100 sequences (FASTA) and their corresponding metadata (TSV) from your GISAID source.

Desired structure:
- sequences.fasta
- metadata.tsv

Run the pipeline with `-profile flu_gisaid_test` to use this data.
