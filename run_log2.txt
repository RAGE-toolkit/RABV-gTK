ERROR ~ Unable to acquire lock on session with ID c36a6815-2cde-4b9c-8816-a59ada93e489

Common reasons for this error are:
 - You are trying to resume the execution of an already running pipeline
 - A previous execution was abruptly interrupted, leaving the session open

You can see which process is holding the lock file by using the following command:
 - lsof /home3/oml4h/RABV-gTK/.nextflow/cache/c36a6815-2cde-4b9c-8816-a59ada93e489/db/LOCK

 -- Check '.nextflow.log' file for details
